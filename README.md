# shortest-path-tooling

Developer dashboards and OSRS cache dumpers for the [shortest-path](https://github.com/Skretzo/shortest-path) RuneLite plugin.

This repo carries `shortest-path` as a git submodule and uses a Gradle [composite build](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html) to consume the plugin's sources — so the dashboard and cache-dumper code never pollutes plugin PRs.

New here? [docs/system-overview.md](docs/system-overview.md) explains how the pieces fit together and the workflows they support.

## Looking for the plugin?

This repository contains **developer tooling** — it is not the plugin itself.

- **To use the plugin:** install *Shortest Path* from the RuneLite Plugin
  Hub. The [plugin repo](https://github.com/Skretzo/shortest-path) and its
  [wiki](https://github.com/Skretzo/shortest-path/wiki) cover features,
  examples, and options. Bugs and feature requests go to the plugin's
  [issue tracker](https://github.com/Skretzo/shortest-path/issues), and
  there's a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/uX47xg8u3M) for help and
  discussion.
- **To browse pathfinding results:** the published dashboard is at
  `https://skretzo.github.io/shortest-path/` — no setup needed.
- **To hack on the plugin or its data:** you're in the right place —
  keep reading.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/osrs-pathfinding/shortest-path-tooling.git
cd shortest-path-tooling
./gradlew dashboard
python -m http.server --directory build/reports/pathfinder-dashboard 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

The published dashboard is also available on GitHub Pages:

`https://skretzo.github.io/shortest-path/`

## Using a separate shortest-path checkout

Developers working on the plugin and tooling side by side can point the tooling
build at an external checkout:

```bash
./gradlew -PshortestPathDir=../shortest-path test
./gradlew -PshortestPathDir=../shortest-path dashboard
```

Paths are resolved relative to `shortest-path-tooling`. The `shortestPathDir`
property controls both the Gradle composite build for
`shortestpath:shortest-path` and the directly compiled plugin test helpers.
The default remains the `./shortest-path` Git submodule.

## Available tasks

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `./gradlew dashboard` | Build the pathfinder dashboard from the default `routes` suite and the `sailing-routes` suite |
| `./gradlew dashboard -PdashboardSuite=clue-locations-full` | Build dashboard from a specific scenario suite (only that one) |
| `./gradlew pagesSite` | Build every bundle of the site the plugin publishes to GitHub Pages (the plugin's Dashboard Pages workflow runs it; change the published bundles in `gradle/dashboards.gradle`) |
| `./gradlew sailingDashboard` | Build only the sailing routes, with the experimental sailing search drawn next to the normal path (needs a plugin checkout with the sailing search) |
| `./gradlew captureExpectedLengths -PdashboardSuite=routes` | Write actual path lengths into the suite's `src/test/resources/scenarios/expected-lengths/<suite>.json` |
| `./gradlew sailingBenchmark` | Time the experimental sailing search against the existing search on routes at sea (needs a plugin checkout with the sailing search) |
| `./gradlew bankTileDump -PbankTileCacheDir=<dir> -PbankTileXteaPath=<keys.json>` | Dump bank-object placements from an OSRS cache to TSV |
| `./gradlew sailingAmenityVarbitDump -PsailingAmenityCacheDir=<dir> -PsailingAmenityXteaPath=<keys.json>` | Dump Sailing island amenity varbits from an OSRS cache |
| `./gradlew routingCuts -PkahipNodeSeparator=<path>` | Generate the A* pathfinder's `routing-cuts.bin` with KaHIP (see below) |
| `./gradlew routingCutsReport` | Report how many committed cuts still apply to the current collision map |
| `./gradlew benchmarkCanonical --args="..."` | Run a resolved benchmark manifest (used by shortest-path-benchmarks) |
| `./gradlew route -ProuteArgs="..."` | Query one canonical route and print its selected path |

The route query uses the same profiles and adapter as `benchmarkCanonical`. PROFILE is any
profile (`early`/`mid`/`end`/`maxed` or a dashboard preset such as `UNIT_TEST`), and
`-ProuteSuite=SUITE -ProuteScenario="NAME"` runs one scenario of any suite
(`-ProuteArgs=--list` lists them). It reads the routes in this checkout's `corpus/`; add
`--algorithm astar`, `--json` or `--counters` as needed. Routes can be given by
corpus ID (`--route ID --profile PROFILE`) or by coordinates:

```bash
./gradlew \
  -ProuteArgs='maxed 2411 4434 0 2995 3114 0 --json' \
  route
```

## A* routing cuts

The plugin's A* pathfinder derives its routing data from `collision-map.zip`
at runtime, using a small list of separator cut edges (`routing-cuts.bin`) to
split large walking areas. `routingCuts` regenerates that file with KaHIP's
`node_separator`, using the plugin's own walking graph:

```bash
./gradlew routingCuts \
  -PshortestPathDir=../shortest-path \
  -PkahipNodeSeparator=$(command -v node_separator) \
  -ProutingCutsOutput=../shortest-path/src/main/resources/routing-cuts.bin
```

KaHIP is not a Gradle dependency. Use `nix-shell -p kahip` or build KaHIP with
CMake (`-DNOMPI=On`) and pass the binary path. The plugin's weekly
`ExtractCollisionMap` workflow runs this task after dumping a new collision map
and commits both files together. Stale cuts only slow preparation down; they
never make exact routes wrong.

## Maintenance

`scripts/maintenance.py` orchestrates post-update data maintenance —
`cache`, `collision-map`, `regions`, `bank`, `seasonal`, `refresh`,
`probes`, and `verify` subcommands wrap the cache download, Gradle
dumpers, and verification tiers in one entry point. See
[docs/maintenance.md](docs/maintenance.md) for the runbook.

The sailing tools in `src/sailing/java` are only compiled when the plugin checkout (`-PshortestPathDir`) has
the experimental sailing search.

## Dashboard options

All options are passed via `-P`:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `dashboardSuite` | `routes` | Scenario suite to run (`./gradlew -q scenarioIndex` lists them; see [docs/scenarios.md](docs/scenarios.md)) |
| `dashboardFilter` | *(empty)* | Run only scenarios whose name or category contains it |
| `dashboardDataset` | *(empty)* | A route JSON file (the canonical route format, run with `ALL`) to run instead of a suite |
| `dashboardBundle` | derived from the suite name | Bundle name in the output site |
| `dashboardTitle` | derived from the suite name | Title shown in the UI |
| `dashboardSubtitle` | *(empty)* | Subtitle shown in the UI |
| `dashboardProfile` | `true` | Whether to enable the profiler |

For the datasets and when to use each, see [docs/dashboard-design.md](docs/dashboard-design.md).

## Canonical corpus benchmark

The canonical routes live in [`corpus/`](corpus/README.md) and the canonical accounts are Java in
[`accounts/`](accounts/README.md). `benchmarkCanonical`, the route CLI and the tests all use this
checkout's routes and accounts, so the tooling commit in a benchmark's execution metadata identifies
both. There is no `--corpus` argument: to benchmark other routes or accounts, check out the tooling
revision that has them.

`benchmarkCanonical` is the integration point for the
[shortest-path-benchmarks](https://github.com/osrs-pathfinding/shortest-path-benchmarks)
harness. It runs exactly the route/profile/repetition cases of a resolved
manifest in one JVM, for the legacy or A* backend:

```bash
./gradlew benchmarkCanonical \
  --args="--manifest /path/to/resolved-experiment.json \
          --output build/benchmarks/java-adapter.json"
```

The output is one protocol-v1 JSON envelope with execution metadata, the Java
VM identity, dependency Git identities, the synthetic benchmark clock, and v2
observations. Expected reachability comes from each route's curated
`negativeProfiles`; there is no expected cost.

Each case is the `canonical` suite scenario `<route id>/<profile>`, run through the same
`ScenarioRunner` as the route CLI and the dashboard; see [docs/scenarios.md](docs/scenarios.md).

CI runs a light benchmark through this adapter (`python3 scripts/benchmark_smoke.py`: two cases on
each backend, checked the way the harness reads them). If you change the adapter's arguments,
manifest format or output, update shortest-path-benchmarks to match.

## Keeping up with the plugin

The `shortest-path` submodule is pinned to a specific commit. To update it to the latest plugin master:

```bash
python3 scripts/maintenance.py collision-map
```

This fast-forwards the submodule to `upstream/master`, prints an edge diff
of the new `collision-map.zip` for review, and stages the gitlink bump
with `--commit`. Do not use `git submodule update --remote` — it checks
out a detached HEAD, which the data-writing subcommands refuse.

## Cache dumpers

The cache dumpers require a local OSRS cache. Download one first:

```bash
python3 scripts/maintenance.py cache
```

The `cache` subcommand downloads the cache and patches `keys.json`
idempotently — never `sed` the file by hand (the BSD/GNU `-i` syntax
differs, and `s/key/keys/g` corrupts `"keys"` into `"keyss"` on re-run).

Then run the desired task (see table above).

The `rebuild_bank_tsv.py` script merges the bankTileDump output into `shortest-path/src/main/resources/destinations/game_features/bank.tsv`:

```bash
python3 scripts/rebuild_bank_tsv.py
```
