# Scenarios, suites and the three runners

Every route this repository plans — a regression test, a canonical benchmark case, a clue
location, an agent's one-off query — is a **scenario**, and every scenario runs through the same
code. This page is the model; the dashboard UI is in [dashboard-design.md](dashboard-design.md).

## Concepts

| Concept | What it is | Code |
|---|---|---|
| **Account** | An account as a player would describe it: levels, quests, diaries, unlocks, items, house, spellbook, clock. `AccountCompiler` turns it into the `ClientState` (varbits, varplayers, items) the plugin reads | `accounts/` → `shortestpath.accounts.Account` |
| **Profile** | A named starting point: an account plus plugin settings. Knows nothing about routes | `shortestpath.profiles.Profiles` |
| **Scenario** | What to run and what counts as correct: a route (start, target, transports allowed) + a profile + account and settings overrides + an expectation. Runs nothing itself | `shortestpath.scenarios.Scenario` |
| **Suite** | A named list of scenarios, some tagged with tiers | `shortestpath.scenarios.Suites` |
| **Runner** | The only code that calls a pathfinder: runs a scenario on the legacy or A* backend (and the A* backend's session modes) and returns an `Observation` | `shortestpath.scenarios.ScenarioRunner` |
| **Observation** | One run's result. `isReached()` and `check()` (reachability, minimum length, exact expected length) are the only definitions of *reached* and *correct* | `shortestpath.scenarios.Observation` |

**Profiles.** The canonical accounts `early`, `mid`, `end`, `maxed` are defined in
`accounts/src/main/java/shortestpath/accounts/canonical/CanonicalAccounts.java`. The presets
`ALL`, `NONE`, `UNIT_TEST`, `SEASONAL` share the harness account (every skill 99, every quest
finished, fairy rings, nothing carried) and differ in settings, plus the Lumbridge elite diary and,
for `SEASONAL`, a seasonal world. `PluginSettings` is the plugin settings object every profile and
scenario uses.

**Expectations.** A scenario is expected reachable or unreachable, and may set a minimum path
length. *Reached* is the engine's verdict, `PathfinderResult.isReached()` (for a target that
cannot be stood on, the plugin routes to its fallback tiles before searching);
`Observation.isReached()` is the only definition. A suite may also keep exact
lengths in `src/test/resources/scenarios/expected-lengths/<suite>.json`, which only the dashboard
checks and `captureExpectedLengths` rewrites.

## Suites

A suite is Java or route data. Write a **Java scenario** when the route needs anything beyond a named
profile: an account fact or raw variable, a setting, a minimum length, a sailing speed. Write a
**JSON route** when it is one of many uniform routes run with named profiles as they are (the canonical
corpus, the clue locations, an ad-hoc file for `-PdashboardDataset`); route files have no override
fields.

| Suite | Source | Scenarios |
|---|---|---|
| `routes`, `unit-tests`, `routing-issues`, `collision-map-issues`, `f2p-routes`, `seasonal-briefcase-routes`, `quetzal-whistle-routes`, `sailing-routes` | Java (`*Scenarios.define(Suite)`) | hand-written, with overrides |
| `clue-locations-full` | route data `src/test/resources/scenarios/clue-locations.json` × `ALL` | clue locations |
| `canonical` | route data `corpus/corpus/routes-v1.json` × `early`/`mid`/`end`/`maxed` | the canonical corpus, tagged `smoke`/`standard`/`full` |

`./gradlew -q scenarioIndex` prints every suite's scenarios as JSON; scripts read suites only from it.

### Java suites

Anything with an override is Java:

```java
static void define(Suite suite) {
    suite.scenario("Mage arena tele (#140) usable after guardian talk", "routing-issue-140")
        .from(3163, 3485, 0).to(3363, 3295, 0)
        .profile(UNIT_TEST)
        .account(a -> a.varbit(VarbitID.MAGICTRAINING_ENTRA_NOOB, 1))
        .settings(s -> {
            s.setUseTeleportationMinigames(true);
            s.setBypassVarbitChecks(false);
        });
}
```

- `.account(a -> ...)` overrides the profile's `Account.Builder` with facts: `quest`, `diary`,
  `unlock`/`lock`, `spellbook`, `minigameTeleportUsedAt`, `inventory`, `equipment`, `bank`, `level`,
  `world`, `location`, `nowMinutes`. A fact sets every variable it implies, so `a.quest(X, FINISHED)`
  also sets X's progress varbits.
- `varbit`/`varplayer` set raw variables, for what no fact describes (league area picks, a quest
  half done). They are applied last and override the facts. Use RuneLite's `gameval` constants
  (`ItemID`, `VarbitID`, `VarPlayerID`).
- `.settings(s -> ...)` overrides `PluginSettings`.
- `Overrides` names the repeated ones: `.account(leagueAreas(LeagueRegion.ASGARNIA, ...))`,
  `.account(eliteDiaries())`, `.settings(bankTeleports())`. Overrides apply in order after the profile.
- `.expectUnreachable()`, `.minimumLength(n)`.
- `.sailing(speed, boat)` makes a route at sea: the dashboard also runs the experimental sailing search
  at that speed, keeping the boat's hull clear (`sailing-routes`; see [dashboard-design.md](dashboard-design.md#sailing)).
- The presets bypass varbit and varplayer *transport* requirements unless a scenario calls
  `s.setBypassVarbitChecks(false)` / `s.setBypassVarPlayerChecks(false)`; the canonical profiles never
  bypass. Bank destination requirements are never bypassed.

Names must be unique within a suite; reports, expected lengths and the issue store use them.

### Variable overrides and the bypass flags

`varbit` and `varplayer` feed two *different* client reads — `getVarbitValue` vs `getVarpValue` — and
they interact with transport gating in a way that is easy to miss:

- Transport TSVs under `transports/` carry separate `Varbits` and `VarPlayers` requirement columns,
  evaluated by `varbitChecks`/`varPlayerChecks` in `PathfinderConfig`.
- The dashboard presets **bypass both checks by default** (`bypassVarbitChecks`/`bypassVarPlayerChecks`
  are `true` in `PluginSettings`), so an overridden id only gates a transport when the
  scenario also calls `s.setBypassVarbitChecks(false)` or `s.setBypassVarPlayerChecks(false)`. The
  canonical profiles never bypass.
- Example: the digsite scenarios in `RoutingIssueScenarios` pair `.varbit(VarbitID.VM_KUDOS, 153)`
  / `0` with `setBypassVarbitChecks(false)` so the kudos varbit actually opens/closes the gate.
- Asymmetry: `destinations/game_features/bank.tsv` requirement columns read the client directly and
  are **never bypassed** — account overrides always feed them.
- Turning a bypass off evaluates *every* requirement of that kind against the account — unset ids
  read `0`, so unrelated transports can gate off too. Re-capture expected lengths afterwards.

### Quests

`.quest(Quest, QuestState)` overrides one quest. The dashboard presets default every other quest to
`FINISHED` (the canonical profiles default to `NOT_STARTED`), and only `FINISHED` satisfies a quest
requirement. Quest states gate more than individual transports: `THE_GRAND_TREE` not finished
disables the whole gnome-glider transport type, `BONE_VOYAGE` gates all magic mushtrees, and
`TREE_GNOME_VILLAGE` gates all spirit trees — plus quest requirements on `bank.tsv` destinations.

### Route data

A route file is a JSON array in the canonical corpus route format:

```json
{"id": "gps-natural-0012", "name": "Cauldron of Thunder → Ice Queen's Lair",
 "start": [2895, 9833, 0], "target": [2861, 9947, 0], "allowTransports": true,
 "tiers": ["smoke", "standard", "full"], "negativeProfiles": ["early"]}
```

Optional fields: `start` (absent: the Grand Exchange), `allowTransports` (default true), `tiers`,
`negativeProfiles` (profiles that must not reach it), `profiles` (instead of the suite's),
`category` (default: the id without its number), and the provenance strings `startName`,
`targetName`, `startSource`, `targetSource`. Unknown fields are rejected — overrides belong in Java.
Each route runs with each profile as scenario `<id>/<profile>`.

## Running scenarios

The three runners select scenarios the same way and run them through `ScenarioRunner`.

**Route CLI** — one scenario, printed (human-readable or `--json`):

```bash
./gradlew route -ProuteSuite=routing-issues -ProuteScenario="#140) usable"     # any suite; name or unique part
./gradlew route -ProuteSuite=canonical -ProuteScenario=gps-natural-0012/maxed -ProuteArgs="--algorithm astar --json"
./gradlew route -ProuteSuite=canonical -ProuteArgs=--list
./gradlew route -ProuteArgs="gps-natural-0012 maxed"                          # = canonical gps-natural-0012/maxed
./gradlew route -ProuteArgs="UNIT_TEST 3222 3218 0 3105 3251 0 --json"         # coordinates with any profile
```

The argument forms and JSON fields are an agent-facing interface; keep them stable.

**Dashboard** — a suite, published as a bundle under `build/reports/pathfinder-dashboard/`:

```bash
./gradlew dashboard -PdashboardSuite=routing-issues
./gradlew dashboard -PdashboardSuite=routing-issues -PdashboardFilter=issue-140   # name or category
./gradlew dashboard -PdashboardSuite=canonical -PdashboardTier=smoke -PdashboardBackend=astar
./gradlew dashboard -PdashboardDataset=my-routes.json                             # an ad-hoc route file (ALL)
./gradlew captureExpectedLengths -PdashboardSuite=routes [-PdashboardFilter=...]
```

**Benchmark adapter** — `./gradlew benchmarkCanonical --args="--manifest M --output OUT"`,
called by shortest-path-benchmarks. Each manifest case (`route_id`, `profile`) is the `canonical`
scenario `<route_id>/<profile>`, with the routes of this checkout's `corpus/` (there is no `--corpus`); the adapter adds the synthetic clock, warmup, A* session modes
(`cold`/`account`/`target`) and timings, and writes the protocol-v1 envelope.

The adapter's routes and accounts are both this checkout's (`corpus/` and `accounts/`; there is no
`--corpus`), and its execution metadata records the tooling and plugin commits, so those commits and the
manifest's cases identify everything a run used. To benchmark other routes or accounts, check out the
tooling revision that has them.

## Expected lengths

Exact path lengths are fixtures, not part of a scenario: `src/test/resources/scenarios/expected-lengths/<suite>.json`
maps scenario name to path length (steps).

- **Capture**: `./gradlew captureExpectedLengths -PdashboardSuite=S` runs the suite and rewrites the file
  with every reached scenario's length; with `-PdashboardFilter=F` it rewrites only the matching entries.
  It is the only command that writes the file.
- **Review**: read the diff. Each changed length should follow from the change being made (a plugin
  re-pin, a scenario or account change); a scenario no longer reached drops out of the file.
- **Verify**: the dashboard checks every run against its expected length (`Observation.check()`) and marks
  mismatches in the bundle's `report.json`; `python3 scripts/maintenance.py verify` sweeps every suite.
  `ScenariosTest` only checks that each file names real scenarios.

## What CI checks

| Tests | Run routes? | What they check |
|---|---|---|
| `:accounts:test` | no | the account compiler and the canonical accounts |
| `ScenariosTest`, `CanonicalCorpusTest`, `ProfilesTest`, `ConfigParityTest` | no | every suite loads and compiles its accounts; names are unique; expected-length files name real scenarios; routes are well formed; profiles and overrides reach the pathfinder config; every plugin setting has a `PluginSettings` twin |
| `RouteCliTest`, `BenchmarkMainTest` | a few canonical routes, legacy and A* | the CLI's forms and the benchmark adapter agree; manifest validation; A* session modes; walking-only routes |
| `scripts/benchmark_smoke.py` | two canonical cases, legacy and A* | `benchmarkCanonical` run as shortest-path-benchmarks runs it, and its output as the harness reads it (keep the two repositories in step) |
| Python `tests/`, `maintenance.py validate` | no | the scripts, and the plugin's committed data |

No CI test runs a whole suite against its expectations (reachability, minimum and exact lengths): that is
the dashboard's job, through `maintenance.py verify` or `./gradlew dashboard -PdashboardSuite=…` and the
bundle's `report.json`.

## Common changes

| To | Do |
|---|---|
| Add a regression | a `suite.scenario(...)` in the right Java suite (issues: `RoutingIssueScenarios`, category `<domain>-issue-<N>`), then `-ProuteSuite=… -ProuteScenario=…` or the dashboard with a filter |
| Add a canonical route | edit `corpus/corpus/routes-v1.json`; `CanonicalCorpusTest` validates it |
| Change a canonical account | edit `accounts/…/canonical/CanonicalAccounts.java` (or `CanonicalItems`) |
| Teach accounts a new fact | a field on `Account` (or an `Unlock`) and its variables in `AccountCompiler` |
| Add a preset | a `preset(...)` in `Profiles` |
| Add a suite | a Java `define(Suite)` or a route file, registered in `Suites` |
