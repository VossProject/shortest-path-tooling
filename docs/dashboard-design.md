# Dashboard Guide

## Purpose

The dashboard is a developer tool for inspecting pathfinder behavior visually.

It exists for cases where a pass/fail assertion is not enough:

- a route is unexpectedly unreachable
- a route reaches the target but uses the wrong transport
- a bank-state transition happens in the wrong place
- a user reports a bad destination and we want a lightweight regression case
- profiling data needs visual inspection (phase timings, heatmaps, queue sizes)

Instead of looking only at a failing JUnit assertion, the dashboard lets you inspect:

- the rendered route on a Leaflet map
- path statistics (nodes checked, transports checked, elapsed time)
- transports used along the path
- where banked state begins
- profiler phase breakdowns, sub-phase timings, and time-series charts
- tile visit heatmaps showing search distribution
- multiple datasets through one shared UI with a bundle selector

## Project Architecture

The dashboard tooling lives in its own Gradle project (`shortest-path-tooling`), separate from the plugin.
The `shortest-path` plugin is included as a [composite build](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html)
via `settings.gradle`, so `testImplementation 'shortestpath:shortest-path'` resolves to the local submodule.

### Key source paths

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/test/java/shortestpath/dashboard/` | Dashboard test runner and report writing |
| `src/test/java/shortestpath/scenarios/` | Scenario suites (Java) and the `Scenario` model |
| `src/test/java/shortestpath/profiles/` | `Profiles`: every named profile (canonical accounts and dashboard presets) |
| `src/test/java/shortestpath/pathfinder/` | `ProfilingPathfinder`, `PathfinderProfile` (test-only instrumented pathfinder) |
| `src/test/java/shortestpath/dump/` | Cache dumpers |
| `src/test/resources/scenarios/` | Route data (`clue-locations.json`) and each suite's `expected-lengths/<suite>.json` |
| `src/test/resources/reachability-dashboard/` | Static frontend assets (`index.html`, `app.js`, `profiler.js`, `styles.css`) |
| `gradle/dashboards.gradle` | Gradle task definitions for all dashboard and capture tasks |
| `gradle/cache-dumpers.gradle` | Gradle task definitions for cache dump tasks |

The `ProfilingPathfinder` and `PathfinderProfile` classes live in this tooling repo, not in the plugin.
They are compiled alongside the dashboard test code and are not shipped as part of the RuneLite plugin.

Two additional files from the plugin's test tree are pulled into compilation via a `compileTestJava.source`
override in `build.gradle`:

- `shortest-path/src/test/java/shortestpath/pathfinder/TestPathfinderConfig.java`
- `shortest-path/src/test/java/shortestpath/TestShortestPathConfig.java`

## Site Model

The dashboard site is a static bundle written to:

`build/reports/pathfinder-dashboard`

It contains one shared frontend plus multiple report bundles:

```text
build/reports/pathfinder-dashboard/
  index.html
  app.js
  profiler.js
  styles.css
  bundles/
    index.json
    <bundle-name>/
      report.json
      heatmaps/
        <run-name>.json     (tile visit counts, one per route)
```

`bundles/index.json` is the registry the frontend reads first. Each bundle directory contains a `report.json`
with all route results and, when profiling is enabled, a `heatmaps/` directory with per-route tile visit count data.

To serve the site locally after building:

```bash
python -m http.server --directory build/reports/pathfinder-dashboard 8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000
```

## Scenarios

The dashboard runs scenario suites. Scenarios, profiles, suites and the route data format are
described in [scenarios.md](scenarios.md); this page covers the dashboard itself.

## Published site

The plugin's Dashboard Pages workflow (`Skretzo/shortest-path` `.github/workflows/dashboard-pages.yml`)
checks out this repository's master and runs `./gradlew pagesSite`, which builds every published
bundle into `build/reports/pathfinder-dashboard`. The bundles, their titles and their order are
`pagesBundles` in `gradle/dashboards.gradle`; change them there, not in the workflow.

## Gradle Tasks

### `dashboard` (default task)

Runs `DashboardTest` against one suite and writes a bundle into the output site.

```bash
./gradlew dashboard \
  -PdashboardSuite=routes \
  -PdashboardBundle=routes-profiled \
  -PdashboardTitle="Routes Profiled"
```

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dashboardSuite` | `routes` | The suite to run (`./gradlew -q scenarioIndex` lists them) |
| `dashboardDataset` | *(empty)* | A route JSON file to run instead of a suite (routes without `profiles` run with `ALL`) |
| `dashboardFilter` | *(empty)* | Run only the scenarios whose name or category contains it (ignoring case), e.g. `issue-140` |
| `dashboardTier` | *(empty)* | Run only scenarios tagged with this tier, e.g. `canonical` with `smoke` |
| `dashboardBackend` | `legacy` | `astar` runs the A* pathfinder (unprofiled); the bundle gets an `-astar` suffix and the title an `A*` suffix |
| `dashboardBundle` | auto-derived from the suite name + profile flag | Bundle directory name |
| `dashboardTitle` | auto-derived from the suite name | Title shown in the UI |
| `dashboardSubtitle` | *(empty)* | Subtitle shown in the UI |
| `dashboardProfile` | auto (on up to 200 scenarios) | Enable profiling (heatmaps, phase timings) |

The bundle name and title are auto-derived when not overridden. For example:
- suite `clue-locations-full`, profiling on → bundle `clue-locations-full-profiled`, title `Clue Locations Full Profiled`
- suite `routes`, profiling off → bundle `routes`, title `Routes`

To build without profiling (faster, no heatmaps):

```bash
./gradlew dashboard -PdashboardProfile=false -PdashboardSuite=clue-locations-full
```

### `captureExpectedLengths`

Like `dashboard` but writes actual path lengths of reached scenarios into
`src/test/resources/scenarios/expected-lengths/<suite>.json`. Use this to bootstrap or refresh
expected lengths after changing pathfinding behavior.

```bash
./gradlew captureExpectedLengths -PdashboardSuite=routes
```

## Profiler

### Architecture

The profiler is a test-only pathfinder that mirrors the production search loop with `System.nanoTime()`
instrumentation at each phase boundary.

Key files:

- `src/test/java/shortestpath/pathfinder/ProfilingPathfinder.java` — mirrors `Pathfinder.java`'s loop, each phase wrapped in nanoTime calls
- `src/test/java/shortestpath/pathfinder/PathfinderProfile.java` — data class collecting all profiling measurements
- `src/test/resources/reachability-dashboard/profiler.js` — frontend rendering (bar charts, time-series, heatmap overlay)

### What It Measures

**Top-level phases** (accumulated nanos per search loop iteration):
- `queueSelection` — dequeuing the next node from the priority queue
- `addNeighbors` — expanding tile and transport neighbors
- `targetCheck` — checking if the current node is a target
- `wildernessCheck` — wilderness level boundary handling
- `cutoffCheck` — cost cutoff evaluation
- `bookkeeping` — iteration counter updates and sampling

**Sub-phases within addNeighbors**:
- `bankCheck` — checking bank proximity for state transitions
- `transportLookup` — looking up transports at the current position
- `collisionCheck` — collision map queries
- `walkableTile` — processing walkable tile neighbors
- `blockedTileTransport` — checking transports on blocked tiles
- `abstractNode` — abstract node expansion

**Counters**:
- `tileNeighborsAdded`, `transportNeighborsAdded` — neighbor counts
- `visitedSkipped` — nodes skipped because already visited
- `transportEvaluations` — total transport evaluations attempted
- `blockedTileTransportChecks` — blocked-tile transport lookups
- `bankTransitions`, `wildernessLevelChanges` — state change counts
- `peakBoundarySize`, `peakPendingSize` — high-water marks for queue sizes

**Time series** (sampled every 2000 iterations):
- boundary queue size, pending queue size, current cost, elapsed nanos

**Heatmap**:
- sparse map of `packedPosition → visitCount` for every tile visited during search

### Keeping the Profiler in Sync

`PathfinderTest.profilingDoesNotAffectResults` verifies that `ProfilingPathfinder` produces identical
results to `Pathfinder` across multiple route types. It checks:

- path equality (every step's position and bank-visited flag)
- result metadata (reached, terminationReason, nodesChecked, transportsChecked)
- profiling data validity (phase nanos > 0, sub-phase nanos > 0, counter consistency, heatmap non-empty)

When modifying `Pathfinder.java`'s search loop, run this test to confirm the profiler still mirrors it.

## How To Choose A Suite

| Situation | Suite / task |
|---|---|
| A new regression or an upstream issue | add a scenario ([scenarios.md](scenarios.md#common-changes)), run its suite with `-PdashboardFilter` |
| Broad sweep after changing core search behavior | `clue-locations-full` or `canonical`, profiling off |
| Legacy vs A* | the same suite with `-PdashboardBackend=astar` |
| Performance analysis (where time is spent, queue sizes) | any suite with `dashboardProfile=true` |
| Bootstrap or refresh expected path lengths | `captureExpectedLengths` |

## Suggested Workflow

**For a performance investigation:**

1. Run `./gradlew dashboard` (profiling on by default).
2. Inspect phase timings, sub-phase breakdowns, and heatmaps in the profiler tab.

For profiling after a pathfinder change:

1. Run profiled bundles for the datasets you care about.
2. Compare heatmaps and phase breakdowns against the pre-change baselines.
3. Use `scripts/analyze_heatmap_counts.py` to get distribution statistics.

## Serving The Site

Open the generated site through a local webserver, not `file://`, because the frontend loads bundle JSON dynamically.

```bash
python -m http.server --directory build/reports/pathfinder-dashboard 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

## Scripts

Helper scripts in `scripts/`:

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `analyze_heatmap_counts.py` | Analyze tile visit count distributions from heatmap JSON files in a bundle |
| `check_tsv.py` | Validate TSV transport files for format errors |
| `tsv-lint.sh` | Lint all transport TSV files |
| `compute_changed_coordinates.sh` | Diff coordinate changes between branches |
| `diff_coordinate_json.py` | Compare coordinate JSON files |
| `dump_transport_coordinates.py` | Extract transport coordinates from TSV files |

## Implementation Split

The implementation is split into:

1. `PathfinderDashboardReportWriter` — builds the report payload (route results, profiler data, metadata)
2. `DashboardBundlePublisher` — publishes a named bundle into the shared site root and updates `bundles/index.json`
3. `PathfinderDashboardAssetWriter` — writes the shared frontend assets (`index.html`, `app.js`, `profiler.js`, `styles.css`)

## Sailing

The plugin's experimental sailing search (on branches that have it) sails the game's 16 boat headings and
keeps the boat's whole hull clear of blocked tiles. It isn't on the plugin's master yet, so point the build
at a checkout that has it with `-PshortestPathDir`; the sailing code here lives in `src/sailing/java` and is only
compiled when that checkout has the sailing search.

### Sailing view

Scenarios with a sailing speed (`.sailing(speed, boat)`, the `sailing-routes` suite in
`SailingRouteScenarios`) also run the sailing search from the same start, and the dashboard draws it in blue next
to the normal path: the path, the boat's hull at each turn (facing the leg that leaves it) and the area the
hull sweeps along each leg, which is what the search keeps clear. Turn on the **Collision map** layer to see
the blocked tiles, and **Sailing hull** to hide the hull. A card compares the two searches.

`./gradlew dashboard` builds the `sailing-routes` suite as its own bundle along with the default routes, unless
it's given a `dashboardSuite` or `dashboardDataset`; `sailingDashboard` builds just that bundle. Without a plugin checkout that has the
sailing search, the sailing routes show only the normal path.

```bash
./gradlew dashboard -PshortestPathDir=../shortest-path
```

Hulls come from the game's bounds for each boat (`SailingBoats`), sitting on the centre of their tile.

### Sailing benchmark

`sailingBenchmark` runs each route in a suite (default `sailing-routes`; scenarios with the same start and
target are one route), with the player on a boat, with the existing search, then with the sailing search at each speed, keeping only the
boat's centre clear and then each boat's hull. Each search runs a few times untimed to warm up, then several
times timed, taking turns. It reports the median and fastest search times (as the plugin's debug panel
measures them), nodes checked and the path found, per route and in total, to
`build/reports/sailing-benchmark/<suite>.md` and `.json`.

The report starts by comparing the paths themselves for each scenario, with its own boat and speed: the
existing path and the sailing path's length in tiles, straight legs, and ticks. The existing path's ticks
are about how long the boat takes to sail it holding the straight or diagonal heading of each step
(`SailingPaths.ticksToSail`). A sailing path with a hull stops as close to the target as the hull fits, so
the existing path is measured up to where it gets that close too. Neither counts time spent turning. The
dashboard's sailing card shows the same comparison.

```bash
./gradlew sailingBenchmark -PshortestPathDir=../shortest-path
./gradlew sailingBenchmark -PshortestPathDir=../shortest-path -PsailingBenchmarkSpeeds=1.5,2.0,2.5,3.0 -PsailingBenchmarkRounds=9
```

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sailingBenchmarkSuite` | `sailing-routes` | Scenario suite to run |
| `sailingBenchmarkSpeeds` | `1.5,3.0` | Boat speeds, in tiles per tick |
| `sailingBenchmarkBoats` | `none,raft,skiff,sloop` | Hulls to keep clear (`none` keeps only the centre clear) |
| `sailingBenchmarkWarmup` | `2` | Untimed runs of each search first |
| `sailingBenchmarkRounds` | `5` | Timed runs of each search |
